# NotCoin-Cheat
[NotCoin_bot cheat script](https://t.me/notcoin_bot) first time in github and ... .

### Automated Script

* This script has been completely reverse-engineered from notcoin bot.

* You should just login to your account with script.

* The algorithm of the script is such that cheats are not detected

* This script has been thoroughly tested and is working fine.

## New Update:
NotCoin Security now uses `TLS v1.3` to secure NotCoin APIs and detect bots. To bypass NotCoin Cloudflare anti-bot measures.

we add `TLS v1.3` to script without extra library like `cloudscraper`, enjoy script.

# installation:

Edit line `11,12` and `153` in "NotCoin.py". In line `153`, it should be your coins multiplied by one click. In line `11,12`, you should put your Telegram `api_id` and `api_hash`.

you can get api id and hash from here <https://my.telegram.org> development part.
