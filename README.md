# NotCoin-Cheat
[NotCoin_bot cheat script](https://t.me/notcoin_bot)

### The purpose of this cheat is to gather coins automatically and then wait 120 seconds before gathering coins again. 

* This scrupt has been completely reverse-engineered from notcoin bot.

* You can obtain the required data, "webapp-data" and "authorize token," with your knowledge and run the script.

I would appreciate it if you give a star and mention the repo.

This script has been thoroughly tested and is working fine.
